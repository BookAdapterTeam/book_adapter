"We are planning to develop BookAdapter, an app that allows users to store their ePub books and as a platform for users to read their books. The app will provide features for the user to organize their library of ePub eBooks into Collections and Series. The app will keep features related to the reader to a minimum, it will focus on core features such as ‘continue reading where you left off’ instead of lots of small customization features. The app will allow users to upload their own ePub files to their library instead of having to use an in-app store."
